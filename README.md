🎓 I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University.

🌟 With a foundation in UX Design, Cognitive Science, and HCI from UC San Diego, I bring a unique perspective to the world of software development.

🛠️ I'm passionate about crafting technology solutions that are not just functional but also human-centered and impactful. I enjoy bringing design prototypes to life through code.

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm exploring various aspects of software development, including:
- Front-end Development
- Back-end Development
- User Experience Design
- Human-Computer Interaction

🤝 I thrive in collaborative environments and have experience working in teams to create and iteratively refine products.
