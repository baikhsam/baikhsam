### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I am a grad student currently completing a MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Having previously studied UX Design, Cognitive Science and HCI at UC San Diego, I am now looking to apply my design experience and skills towards software development. 

# My experience working on teams to create and iteratively refine products as a designer brings a unique perspective to the engineering side of product development. My passions lie in creating technologies that are human-centered and impactful. I enjoy being able to bring design prototypes to life through code.
